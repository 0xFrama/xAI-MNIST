This repo contains code I wrote during my internship.


The main goal was to develop a simple Neural Network (a ResNet model) that with the help of an active learning algorithm (in this case, GradCAM) was able to explain its predictions on the MNIST dataset.

# To run the code:
    python gc_debug.py
